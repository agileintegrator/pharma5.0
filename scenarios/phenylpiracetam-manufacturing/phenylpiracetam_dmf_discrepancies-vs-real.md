# Discrepancies between the mock phenylpiracetam DMF and a real DMF
---
Here are the key discrepancies that would give this away as a test document:

## **Regulatory/Legal Issues**
- **Real phenylpiracetam is unscheduled but not GRAS** - my "GRAS notification pending" is fictional
- **No legitimate pharma company would file a DMF** for an unregulated nootropic (waste of money)
- **Patent number is fake** - real patents would be findable in USPTO database
- **Made-up regulatory pathway** - phenylpiracetam wouldn't go through traditional FDA drug approval

## **Technical Red Flags**
- **Overly convenient specs** - real analytical limits are messier, often like "97.5-102.3%" not neat round numbers
- **Missing method transfer data** - real DMFs include extensive inter-lab validation studies
- **Suspiciously clean impurity profile** - actual synthesis would have more degradants and side products
- **Stability data too perfect** - real compounds usually show *some* degradation trends

## **Manufacturing Reality**
- **Fictional manufacturing site** - "Synthetic Solutions International" doesn't exist
- **Unrealistic capacity claims** - 500 kg/year would require actual demand forecasting
- **Missing supplier qualifications** - real DMFs include extensive vendor audits and raw material specs
- **No process validation batches** - would need demonstration runs with full documentation

## **Data Gaps**
- **No polymorph screening** - critical for any crystalline API
- **Missing genotoxic impurity assessments** - required extensive safety studies
- **Overly simple synthetic route** - real phenylpiracetam synthesis involves more complex stereochemistry
- **No bioavailability data** - even for DMFs, some pharmacokinetic info expected

The biggest tell? A real company wouldn't spend $500K+ filing a DMF for a compound they can't legally market as a drug in the US! 

Perfect for data modeling though - all the complexity, none of the compliance liability.
